Solve maze
A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block and destination block is lower rightmost block
 A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in four directions: up, down, left, right.
 In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination. 

For Example : 
                {1, 0, 0, 0}
                {1, 1, 0, 1}
                {0, 1, 0, 0}
                {1, 1, 1, 1}
  This is the  display (grey block is dead ends = 0)
