Solve maze
A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block and destination block is lower rightmost block
 A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.
 In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination.
